    <h1>Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="../bolognese.jpg" width="400" height="400">
    <p>This homemade Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan.</p>
    <p>She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food. At a time when most</p>
    <p>Americans thought Bolognese was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger,</p>
    <p>Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it</p>
    <p>with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a</p>
    <p>sprinkle of parsley.</p>
